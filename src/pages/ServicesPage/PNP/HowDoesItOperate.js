      <h1>How does the PNP Program Operates </h1>
      <p>
        The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is administered by the Canadian
        federal immigration authority to invite professionals worldwide who
        possess qualifications, relevant skills, and work experience to work and
        settle in Canada as permanent residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program's objective is to attract skilled workers capable of
        bolstering the economy of specific provinces/territories. Each province
        in Canada has its own immigration programs designed to invite needed
        skilled workers, professionals, and other immigrant groups such as
        entrepreneurs, students, and semi-skilled workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pursue <b>Permanent Residency</b> in a specific Canadian province, an
        applicant must first determine which immigration program suits them and
        then proceed with either a paper-based or online application process
        through Express Entry. To avoid potential errors during the application
        process, it's crucial to follow the guidance of experienced Immigration
        Consultants. These processes typically entail undergoing a medical
        examination to ensure fitness for the country and obtaining a police
        clearance certificate from the local police station.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Paper-Based Process: </b>Under the paper-based process, which falls
          under a non-Express Entry stream, an applicant applies to a province
          for nomination. These applications are now suspended and only digital
          applications are accepted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Express Entry Online Process: </b>
          <p>
            There are two methods to apply through the online Express Entry
            process.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>
                An applicant may liaise with the province and seek nomination
                under an Express Entry stream.{" "}
              </b>
              Subsequently, upon receiving nomination from the Canadian
              province, they create an Express Entry profile (or update an
              existing one) to notify the authorities of the nomination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>
                Alternatively, an applicant can directly create an Express Entry
                profile and express interest in immigrating to the preferred
                province.{" "}
              </b>
              Moreover, should the province or territory issue a "notification
              of interest" to their account, the applicant can contact the
              province directly. When applying through the Express Entry stream,
              the province may extend a nomination through the applicant's
              account.
            </li>
