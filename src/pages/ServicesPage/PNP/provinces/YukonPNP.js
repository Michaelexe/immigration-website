      <h2>Yukon PNP</h2>
      <p>
        The Yukon Nominee Program (YNP) facilitates the hiring of skilled
        workers to fill job vacancies in the territory. To manage the high
        volume of applications effectively and ensure the continuity of
        essential business operations, the Immigration Branch has established
        priority criteria for application processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications are categorized into four groups, with priority given to
        each group in the following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Current work permit holders with imminent expiration dates.</li>
        <li>Visitor visa holders already residing in Canada.</li>
        <li>
          Current work permit holders whose permits will expire within a year.
        </li>
        <li>Individuals currently residing outside Canada.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It's important to note that meeting these criteria does not guarantee an
        expedited decision before a foreign national's legal status expires. The
        standard processing time is typically 12 to 14 weeks but may vary based
        on application volume and priority criteria.
