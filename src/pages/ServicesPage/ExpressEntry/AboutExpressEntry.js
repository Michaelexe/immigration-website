      <h2>What is Express Entry in Canada Immigration?</h2>
      <p>
        The Express Entry program, initiated in 2015, aims to streamline the
        immigration process digitally, reducing turnaround times. It utilizes an
        online application management system developed by Immigration, Refugees
        and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Applicants enter a pool, and eligible
        candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA). Once invited, their
        professionally prepared immigration files are submitted to Canadian
        authorities through the Express Entry portal. Successful candidates
        receive a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) and a single-entry
        PR Visa for travel to Canada.
      </p>
      <h2>What is PNP in Canada Immigration?</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to federal programs, provinces and territories have the
        authority to nominate candidates based on their needs. This is known as
        the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), where candidates express an intent
        to settle in a particular province and receive a nomination letter. This
        PNP nomination carries 600 additional points in the candidate's Express
        Entry profile. For more information,{" "}

      </p>
      <h2>Who can apply through the Express Entry Canada system?</h2>
      <p>
        Applicants eligible for at least one of the three federal program
        categories can apply:

      <ul>

        <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
        <li>Federal Skilled Trades Class (FST Program) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some candidates under Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) can apply
        through Express Entry, provided they meet eligibility criteria for at
        least one federal program.
      </p>

      <h2>CRS Points in Express Entry Canada Immigration</h2>
