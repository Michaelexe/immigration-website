        Canada (IRCC) for immigration and citizenship applications by enhancing

      <p>
        In the Express Entry system, candidates are awarded points based on
        various factors, including language proficiency in English and French.
        Higher language proficiency scores in both English and French can
        significantly increase a candidate's CRS score (up to 74 points),

        The score requirements for the TCF/TEF exam vary depending on the
        immigration program and the specific requirements of the province or
        territory to which the individual is applying. Generally, higher
        language proficiency scores lead to higher CRS, and a definite chance by
        securing an ITA in the Francophone category.

        Candidates are required to achieve a minimum score in each language
        skill assessed by the TCF/TEF exam, including listening, speaking,
        reading, and writing. However, the maximum score requirements or levels
        C1 and C2 provide a great boost in the CRS score. Whilst specific

        well, so it can be a game changer for an achiever.
