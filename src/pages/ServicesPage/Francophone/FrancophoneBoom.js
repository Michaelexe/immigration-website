        As an immigration partner, we cater to an international audience and
        frequently interact with individuals aspiring to attain Canadian
        Permanent Residency (PR) by harnessing the power of French language
        proficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gets difficult to begin to understand where do we start, beginning
        French learning is daunting, and attaining a B2/C1 level a mammoth task.
        Not anymore, when we at Canadanprcalling facilitate the French-Language
        Proficiency (TEF/TCF) exam based learning solutions, it evidently
        becomes Your Route to Canadian PR.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief, we provide comprehensive guidance on enhancing your language
        skills and leveraging them for a successful immigration application.

        Many professionals seeking relocation to Canada from their home
        countries or other places of residence may find that acquiring
        additional language skills, regardless of age, academic background, or
        work experience, can be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this in mind, we have designed a curriculum to introduce
        international students, visitors, temporary foreign workers, and other
        prospective immigrants to the benefits and resources for learning
        French:
      </p>
      <p>
        Because a prospective immigrant who is single, less than the age of 30,
        has their education verified as Masters (no two or more degrees) gets
        CLB 10 in their language test (with one language) and has more than 3
        years of work experience will have a CRS of 481. In February 2024, the
        current trends are around 535, (Feb 13th, 2024 draw) which without a
        Canadian education or work experience or French or English as a second
        language apart from the criteria listed above, is impossible to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, learning French provides a leverage to the CRS score as it
        provides at least 62/74 points to the total of 481 making it 543/555.
