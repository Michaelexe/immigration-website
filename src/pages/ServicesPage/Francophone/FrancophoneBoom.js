        Imagine a PR aspirant, who is single, less than the age of 30, has their
        education verified as Masters (no two or more degrees) gets CLB 10 in
        their language test (with one language) and has more than 3 years of
        work experience. They will have a CRS of 481.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the ongoing trend in February 2024 exhibits, the scores of CRS
        cut-off are around 535, (as per Feb 13th, 2024 draw). As implicit,
        people able to cut it without a Canadian Education or Work Experience or
        French or English as a second language. Thus apart from the criteria
        listed above, the Canadian PR will be even more competitive.

        Therefore, learning French provides an advantage to the CRS score as it
        provides at least 62/74 points to the total of 481 making it 543/555.
